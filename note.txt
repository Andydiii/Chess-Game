check & capture are easy to check
in validmove(), check if after move, enemy is captured or enemy king is now in check

for escape, need to track if cur piece is udnercap before and after move

(done) when leave setup, should set capture status for all pieces
(done) when making newboard, should set capture status for all pieces

(do this now) after move, should update capture status for all pieces





TODO:

(done) 2. test pawn promotion (human & robot1-4)
(should be fine) 4. test that robot indeed fallback to regmove when there are no alphamove
(done) 5. instant draw when only two king left
(done) 6. add pawn promotion -> in valid move (board.cc)

(done) 1. add human::move handle for pawn promotion (MUUUUUUUUUUST SPECIFY TYPE FOR PAWN PROMOTION)

(done) 3. add robot4 (prefer checkmate above all other moves, MAYBE smart pawn promotion)

(done) 7. check the pawn promotion lead to checkmate case for robot (robot4 should priorituize this move always)

(done) 1. robot4 smart pawn promotion
pawn promote to knight will checkmate but queen will not
